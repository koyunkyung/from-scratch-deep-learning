## From-Scratch Deep Learning
This repository is dedicated to systematically documenting the learning process of the "Deep Learning from Scratch" series. It includes self-implemented deep learning models, insights from the books, and personal notes and experiments. The primary goal is to internalize the theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning by reimplementing and building upon the concepts presented in the series.

---

### Goals
- Understand deep learning from fundamentals to advanced concepts.
- Implement all models from scratch without referencing the code.
- Compare my implementations with the book's models.

---

### Learning Approach
1. **Theoretical Summaries**:
   key concepts and formulas summarized by chapter
2. **Code Implementation**:
   reimplementation of book examples followed by experiments and improvements
3. **Result Analysis**:
   visualizing and interpreting training results through graphs and metrics
4. **Applied Projects**:
   applying learned knowledge to various datasets and custom problems
